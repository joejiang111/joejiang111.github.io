            Families Are Still Struggling to Pay Medical Costs Despite Nearly
            Universal Health Coverage in Massachusetts<br />
          </p>
          <p id="p1">
            Massachusetts is a national leader in its pursuit of universal
            health care coverage. More than 97% of Massachusetts residents have
            health insurance. In spite of this, affordability issues persist
            across all groups regardless of age, gender, race, health status, or
            family income.
            <br />
            <br />
            Below, CHIA looks at four different areas that are affecting
            Massachusetts residents: <br />Medical Bills, Unexpected Medical
            Bills, Medical Debt, and High Deductible Health Plans.
